# recipe-website
An example website with various recipes. 

The purpose of this project is to get comfortable with Git, Github, and HTML. By the end of this project, I expect to have a good fundamental knowledge of the HTML boilerplate and common HTML tags, including links, images, and text. 

All recipes and pictures on the website belong to their respective owners.
